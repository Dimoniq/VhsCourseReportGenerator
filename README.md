# VhsCourseReportGenerator

This tool can help you generate a report about your students' progress at https://vhs-lernportal.de/. 
It counts all completed and attempted exercises and exports them grouped by course/student/week into excel.

As an initial setup you have to configure your login credentials and probably adjust the weeks. 

Google chrome is a must for the project to work.
